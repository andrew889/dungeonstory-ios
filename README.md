Dungeon Story
================

This is the open source release of the Dungeon Story Puzzle/RPG game for iOS.

There are two main reasons behind open sourcing Dungeon Story: (i) to support
the open source game dev community; and (ii) to help other people with their
own iOS game projects.

Please note that this is being released without any kind of support. I cannot
help you in getting the project running, nor can I guarantee that you will be
able to get it to work. I also do not hold any responsibility or guarantee that
it won't blow up your computer and/or iOS device if you do try and use it. Use
it entirely at your own risk and responsibility.

Note: The font and sounds are not included with this open source release.

## ToDos

* Additional gameplay balancing
