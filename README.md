Dungeon Story
================

This is the open source release of the Dungeon Story Puzzle/RPG game for iOS.

There are two main reasons behind open sourcing Dungeon Story: (i) to support
the open source game dev community; and (ii) to provide an example of a complex
Puzzle/RPG game that other people can use as a basis/template to build their own
iOS games.

guarantee that you will be able to get it running. I also do not hold any
responsibility or give any guarantee that Dungeon Story won't blow up your
computer and/or iOS device(s) if you do try and use it. Use Dungeon Story
entirely at your own risk and responsibility.
